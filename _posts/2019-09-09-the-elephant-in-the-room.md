&nbsp;

If you want to **skip the hassle of selling your home this fall**, we have a new option for you: We can get an offer on your home from companies who want to buy it, instead of individuals on the traditional market.

When you call, just let us know whether you prefer **maximum value** or **maximum convenience**.

This means:

* Youâ€™ll close quickly and get equity from your home in as little as seven days
* You pick your closing date
* No showings or open houses
* No negotiating with buyers
* Skip the cost, time, and (in some cases) embarrassment of getting your home market-ready
* Freedom to move on your own timeline
* No strangers and Realtors walking through your home
* No risk of two mortgage payments
