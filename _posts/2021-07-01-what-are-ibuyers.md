What’s an iBuyer? They’re institutional or cash buyers, and they’re another way to sell your home besides the traditional way of putting it on the market. These companies buy homes to eventually resell.&nbsp;

There are many iBuyers to choose from, but you should call us first. Our focus is to ensure you know all your options before making a decision. We can show you what it would look like if you sold your home the traditional way with a yard sign, open house, and showings. We can also show you what it would look like to work with an iBuyer.&nbsp;

**We’ve built excellent relationships with plenty of iBuyers, so we have an array of options for you.** They all have different programs, so the best one will depend on your circumstances. You’ve likely heard of some of them: Opendoor, Offerpad, Zillow, but there are numerous other options. We want you to see the full picture so you can decide what works best for yourself and your family.

Please contact us so that you’re represented when working with an iBuyer; it’s a completely different transaction than with a traditional sale. We’ll make sure to get you the best offer, help negotiate repairs, and manage all the other opportunities during the process so you know exactly what you’re doing.&nbsp;

If you’re considering selling or have any questions about iBuyers or real estate in general, call or email us. We look forward to helping you.
