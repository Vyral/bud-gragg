<center><em>We wanted to quickly let you know the best way to refer us to your friends and family.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Thank you so much for your referrals over the years\! **We cannot tell you how grateful we are for you and all that you’ve done for us**. This is an extension of the last blog post we did about referring us. Feel free to <u><a target="_blank" href="https://budandkristin.com/let-us-be-your-trusted-referral-source.html">watch that video here</a></u>\!

Today’s message is about referring us the correct way. We just want to ask you a tiny favor about referring us. After you have recommended us, please don’t just give them our business card or tell them our information. What we would like you to say is: “Do you mind if I have Bud and Kristin call you?” Then send us their contact information.

This way, they’ll be expecting our phone call. That’s the way we can effectively communicate with them. There are countless times that we’ve heard from you, our past clients, that you told someone about us (which is great\!), but we never hear from them.

**We ask that you let us contact them so that we can take care of them the way we’ve taken care of you in the past**. There’s no pressure. It doesn’t matter whether they’re buying or selling even two years from now—we’re never going to pressure anyone.

We greatly appreciate all of you for what you’ve done for us. Thank you\! If you ever have any questions concerning real estate, please feel free to reach out to us by phone or email. We would love to help you\!
