I have a question for you: What the %&\*\# is an “iBuyer?” The “i” stands for “institutional,” but here’s what they really are: They’re cash buyers flooding our marketplace trying to gobble up properties left and right. Ever seen those “cash for homes” signs around town? Those are examples of iBuyers.

Here in Phoenix, iBuyers are buying real estate on a large scale right now. Although many agents would argue that they only give lowball offers, they’re flippers, etc, **my team has embraced iBuyers as the market has shifted.** What if I told you there was a team out there who could take your listing, market it to iBuyers before listing it on the open market, and possibly get you top dollar without having to go on the MLS. This is what we can do for our clients.

**It comes down to convenience.** We are happy to meet with you, sign a listing contract, and submit your house to 15 different cash buyers. They’ll compete for your home, and you may be surprised by the prices you’ll receive.&nbsp;

We’ve been doing this for the past year or so, and **about 60% of the offers we’re getting from these cash buyers are very close to market value.** We’ve been tracking this, and we’re excited about the opportunities this presents to homeowners out there. If we can net you more with an iBuyer than we would on retail, we’ll certainly do it. I don’t know of any other team that’s doing this, and it’s by far the best way to sell your home for top dollar.

There are a number of added advantages to selling to an iBuyer. You can often stay in the home longer, don’t have to do inspections or repairs, and it’s overall a more convenient way to sell if the numbers are right.

If you or anyone you know is considering selling to an iBuyer or just selling in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone o remedial. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
