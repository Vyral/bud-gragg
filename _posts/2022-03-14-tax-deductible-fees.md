Nobody likes who likes doing taxes, but there are two small bits of enjoyment I get out of doing them. First, getting them done comes with an intense sense of satisfaction that I don’t have to deal with it for another 12 months. Secondly, I get to take a close look at my personal and business spending for the entire year. It’s eye-opening to see where your money is going and it’s great to red-light-green-light your expenses.

**If you have done business with my team in the last year, certain fees on your settlement statement are tax-deductible.** Everyone knows that mortgage interest and property taxes are tax-deductible, but there are other fees on this settlement sheet that are potentially tax-deductible such as some lender fees and title fees. If you did do business with us in the last year, please get in touch if you don’t have a copy of your HUD1 settlement sheet.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
