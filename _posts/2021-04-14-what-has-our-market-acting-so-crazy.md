The real estate market in the Phoenix metropolitan area is absolutely looney.&nbsp;

On the seller side, my team and I are getting multiple offers for pretty much every listing we take—as long as they’re in good condition and show correctly (i.e., they’re turnkey). If you’re thinking of selling or know anyone who is, get in touch with us. My wife Kristin handles the listing side, and she’s a pro at bouncing offers off of each other to create more equity for you and put more money in your pocket.&nbsp;

**We have low inventory and high demand, and it’s creating a bit of a frenzy.** That said, we’re doing a fantastic job of getting sellers top dollar. A couple of weeks ago, in fact, we put a home on the market that sold for $28,000 over asking price. On the buyer side, you’re wearing the other shoe, so to speak, in that you’re up against other offers. The good news is, my team and I know every trick in the book to help you stand out to sellers.

If you want to sell your home but aren’t sure where you’ll move to next (which is a common dilemma in this market), **I have a solution for you: bridge financing.** We’ve partnered with a company that will lend you the money for the down payment on your next home *and* help you make mortgage payments on your current home while it’s on the market. We’ll probably sell your current home so quickly, though, that this type of assistance won’t be needed. They’ll also lend you up to $25,000 to prepare your home for the market.&nbsp;

If you’d like to take advantage of this offer or have any real estate needs I can assist you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you, and I hope you have an amazing day\!
