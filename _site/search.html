        "content": "We hold many different titles and designations. Here&rsquo;s what they all mean.Have you ever noticed all of the titles that Kristin and I have behind our names? Titles like ABR, CSA, CNE, RCSD, etc. Today I just wanted to give you a quick overview of all the designations that we hold and how earning them has allowed us to develop our wide breadth of real estate knowledge:  Certified Residential Specialist (CRS) means that weâre specialists in the residential realm of real estate sales.  Graduate, Realtor Institute (GRI) means that we know how to handle everything.  E-PRO is a designation that means we are up to date on all the latest real estate technology and know-how to use it to help ourselves and our clients.  ABR stands for Accredited Buyerâs Representative.âAll these titles show how much we care about helping our clients succeed.â  CSA stands for Certified Staging Advocate. This is all about preparing your home like a product for sale. Little details matter, and we know which ones matter most.  CNE stands for Certified Negotiation Expert and MCNE stands for Master Certified Negotiation Experts. These are two designations that weâve earned in the art of the deal. Using tactics and leveraging market conditions to your benefit is what we do.  Broker. This is one of our fundamental designations. Anybody can pass the real estate licensing exam, but a broker has taken it to the next level with an additional 90 hours of training and another state exam. Iâve been a broker for over 20 years.  RCS-D is our newest designation. It stands for Real Estate Collaborative Specialist- Divorce. To put that simply, it means we have been trained to handle this specific type of real estate situation dealing with a divorcing or divorced couple. There are a lot of pitfalls to be wary of in a situation like this, but we know how to handle them.All of these titles and designations are our way of showing you how much we care about representing you to the best of our abilities no matter your situation. If you or someone you know wants to buy, sell, or invest in real estate, donât hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you.",

        "content": "Today I&rsquo;m sharing the differences between the real estate market in 2005 and 2020.Today Iâm discussing 2005 versus 2020. Recently, we were asked by a buyer if she should wait until the market crash is over to buy a home. She believed wholeheartedly that we were headed for a market crash. About a year ago, I did a market update concerning the real estate market here in the Valley and we anticipated a bit of a slowdown in 2019. However, guess what? I was wrong. 2019 saw interest rates below 4%, which boosted the economy.Thereâs a consensus out there that a recession is imminent and there will be another downturn in the market in 2020. Times have changed, and there are quite a few differences between the years 2005 and 2020. At the end of 2019, U.S. unemployment is at 3.5%, the lowest itâs been since June 1953. When adjusted for inflation, todayâs home prices are lower than at the peak of 2006, which contributed to the crash.Subprime and non-prime mortgage lending are at record lowsâless than 5% in todayâs market, as compared to 20% in 2005. That was the single biggest difference in the real estate market crash of 2006 to 2007. Today, there are stricter lending guidelines and standards, reducing the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on their mortgages. Today, homebuyers are more cautious, and theyâre electing to retain equity in their homes instead of borrowing against them, as in the disaster of 2005.â2019 saw interest rates below 4%, which boosted the economy.âWe are in a strong, steady, appreciating market, as opposed to a fast peak and a quick valley. Keep in mind that, nationwide, there are different markets and different stories. Here in Phoenix, 202 people a day are still moving to Maricopa County. Businesses are relocating here in droves.If you have any real estate needs, even just a referral for a vendor, get in touch with us by phone or email. We would love to help you.",

        "title": "Would You Be Better Off Buying Rental Properties or a New Boat?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What can you gain by investing in real estate? Let me tell you a quick story to answer this question.To illustrate the benefits of real estate investing, I want to tell you a quick story.It all starts about 22 years ago when we were living in a subdivision in Mountain Park Ranch (my âofficeâ was the front of my house). One day a neighbor visited us and said sheâd been saving money for three or four years so she could buy a boat for her family. She had between $45,000 and $50,000 in the bank, and she was ready to pull the trigger.Thatâs when she asked, âShould I pay cash for this boat?â We took a second to think about it and said no. Then we told her what weâd do insteadâand what we recommended she should do.We told her to take that $50,000 and use it to buy two rental properties (3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a 2-car garage, 1,600 square feet, etc.) worth roughly $200,000 at 10% down. Financing was about 6% to 7% at the time, which made the mortgage payments about $1,000 to $1,100 per month. If you were to rent these properties at $1,300 to $1,500, that would mean a cash flow of $300 per month for each.Then, if she were to use financing to purchase the boat for, say, $40,000 at an amortization timeline of 80 months, that would cost $400 per month. With the $600 in cash flow, sheâd be able to cover the boat payment with $200 to spare for gas, repairs, etc.âSure enough, the next day we watched as she came home and backed her new boat into her driveway.âBy doing this, her tenants would be paying for both of the mortgages on her properties and the boat. Whatâs more, those properties would each be worth about $400,000 today. That would give her $800,000 in real estate assets, and they would more or less be paid off at this time. Not to mention all the tax benefits she could take advantage of.We spent about an hour laying out this scenario to her. Sure enough, the next day we watched as she came home and backed her new boat into her driveway. Thatâs rightâshe used the cash to buy the boat.Granted, not everyone has the stomach to be a landlord, and weâre still dear friends with this neighbor. Weâve even been on her boat a few times.

If so, I have good news: I have honestly never seen a better time to invest. Itâs a perfect storm here in the Valley; interest rates have never been lower, and there are rumors that theyâre going to edge down a little more. If they do, itâll be a long-term record; theyâve never been that low.Hereâs a relevant story:I own a rental property by Intel in Chandler, and itâs not a fancy, upscale home by any stretch. Itâs a Shea Home with three bedrooms, two-and-a-half baths, 2,000 square feet, a loft pool, and a Jacuzzi in the backyard. I fixed it up to look nice and put it on the market about 10 days ago. In just two days, I had over 30 inquiries to rent the property and three applicationsâI hadnât even shown the property yet!âI have honestly never seen a better time to invest.âThis clearly indicates that demand is through the roof. As a landlord, this is very exciting to me because I get to cherry-pick the best tenants. I did a two-year lease and got $2,300 for the place, which is $150 more than the last tenant. The tenant is single and a surgeon, so Iâm confident she can afford the place. At $2,300 a month, that comes out to $55,000 I made when I signed that lease. Sure, Iâm paying the principal, interest, taxes, and insurance on the property, but Iâve got $700 to $800 cash flow that I can channel towards the principal to pay the property down over the course of 10 years.So, if youâve ever thought about investing in real estate here in the Valley, reach out to me. I would love to help you create wealth like I have done with so many others in real estate, including myself. There are all different types of properties to invest in for different reasons, and we can discuss which would be right for your goals. Hope to hear from you soon!",

There are several things people often forget when moving, and today weâll be highlighting just a few. The next time you pack your bags to head to a new home, always make sure to complete these crucial tasks:1. Determine if youâll need to switch banks. Unless your old bank happens to have a branch near your new home, you may need to switch banks entirely. This may be tedious, but youâll be glad you did it once youâre done.2. Find a new healthcare provider and pharmacy. Calling your current doctor to have prescriptions transferred to a pharmacy near your new home will give you plenty of time to search for a new healthcare provider after youâve moved in. Of course, you should still keep the contact information for your old doctor so that you can have paperwork and medical recorders forwarded once youâve got a new provider.3. Transfer your memberships to local clubs or gyms.4. Request records from your childrenâs school(s). This way, you can take these records with you to their new school district.5. Raid the kitchen. About a month before you move, start thawing out and using the food youâve had sitting in your freezer and refrigerator so that they are clean and empty before moving day.Â 6. Get your car checked up. Your vehicle should be in good working order before you make the trip to your new home.7. Transfer your utilities. Electricity, gas, trash collection, internet, and all other utilities will need to be canceled and/or transferred.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "How long does it actually take to sell a house? That&rsquo;s a complicated question.Â âHow long does it take to sell a house?âTruth be told, thatâs a loaded question.According to Realtor.com, the average number of days on market across the country is about 65 days. However, there are some different factors that I like to bring up when answering this question for clients:1. Location. How close are you to a main street or a transportation hub in your town? This can play a huge part in todayâs buyerâs decision to purchase your home, and how quickly they do so.2. Price. Obviously, you donât want to overprice your home when you place it on the market. I discussed the dangers of pricing your home too high in a previous video, which you can watch here. If you do, youâll shrink the pool of buyers looking at your home, and it could also cause issues with the appraisal if you actually did find a buyer who was willing to pay too muchâthatâs a topic for another time.3. Inventory. How many homes in your neighborhood are currently up for sale? Weâve seen neighborhoods with no houses for sale, which is ideal because that means thereâs no competition. However, weâve also seen neighborhoods with so many houses for sale that itâs almost impossible to calculate how long it would take to sell your home.âIf a buyer is offering you a cash deal, then your house can in as few as seven days.â4. School districts. This tends to be a huge factor for buyers, especially those with children. A lot of people visit school rating websites to see what schools are like in an area.5. Walkability. Did you know that fewer and fewer people are driving these days? Walkability is an important criterion for todayâs buyers. Is your house somewhere close to coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants, or nightlife attractions? Having a better walkability score makes your home more marketable.6. Type of buyer. What kinds of buyers are looking to purchase your home? If theyâre offering you a cash deal, then your house can close in as few as seven days. Financed buyers like those with FHA or VA loans will take a bit longer. The rule of thumb is to establish a 30-day close of escrow once you get a buyer with a loan.If you have any questions about selling a home or real estate in general, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

Your homeâs days on market is like acid to its sale price. The longer it sits on the market at the wrong price, the less youâll get for it in the long run. Buyers donât care about how much money you want to put in your pocket. All they care about is getting a fair market price.When you overprice your home, what youâre actually doing is helping all the other comparable homes in the area sell. Your home might be gorgeous, but buyers make decisions based on value.âYour homeâs days on market is like acid to its sale price.âThe barometer of your homeâs true value is how many interested buyers walk through its front door. How do we know? Whenever our team lists a property for one of our clients, we know that itâs overpriced if we only get one or two showings in the first week. After we adjust the price and start attracting five to 10 showings per week, we know weâre close to getting an offer. If we still donât get an offer after this period, however, weâll make another small adjustment.This is why itâs important to price your home correctly from the get-go when you list it.If you have any other real estate questions for me or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home soon, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

For buyers that purchase a home at the median sale price of $260,000, thatâs about $100 more on your monthly mortgage payment from last year.Buyers averaged 1,845 sq ft. at this price, which is nearly 100 square feet smaller than the average from a year ago.âHome prices will continue to rise, but at a slower pace than in the past.âRenting may not be a suitable alternative anymore.

        "content": "Here are the stats from the fourth quarter of the 2018 real estate market year for the entire Phoenix area.Â Like the stock market, in real estate, thereâs good and bad news to be found on any given day.Here is some news that isnât necessarily bad, though it might seem that way for the uncertain: Every single mortgage broker, banker, and financial planner that I know is advising that mortgage interest rates are going to hit 6%, or possibly even higher. This is a no-brainer because thereâs really only one way for rates to go (which is up). Weâve been very, very spoiled with interest rates for about the last eight years now, as theyâve been ridiculously low.Buyers who are looking to make a home purchase but are currently on the fence should get in touch with me as soon as possibleâhigher interest rates mean more interest costs on your mortgage loan. Generally, higher rates mean less buying power, so the higher the rate, the less home youâll be able to afford. By waiting, homes that are available right now might not be within your reach if rates go up higher.Higher interest rates also mean that sellers might not be that apt to put their home on the market, meaning that there will be less inventory. If theyâve got a locked-in 4% rate, theyâre not going to jump at a 6% or 6.5%.âFour of the top five cities for job growth in the country are located right here in Maricopa County.âThe good news is that tech companies are blowing up the Valley of Sun. Companies like Intel, American Express, eBay, Uber, Shutterfly, and Infusionsoft all have something in common: Theyâre either expanding or relocating their entire company here to the Valley. Every day, at least 202 are moving to Maricopa County.An analysis that was conducted by ranking the future job-growth projections of 182 cities in the United States came up with this top five list:  Chandler, Arizona  Scottsdale, Arizona  San Francisco, California  Peoria, Arizona  Gilbert, ArizonaThatâs right! Four of the top five cities for growth are located right here in Maricopa County. And, according to research done by Zillow, Phoenix, Denver, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Las Vegas, and San Jose will outperform the rest of the United States in 2019.The bottom line is that we are currently living in the strongest economy in the U.S., and we donât expect that to change for a while. We have seen steep appreciation over the past eight years, so I understand peopleâs reluctance to act in the market. However, we believe that appreciation will slow down as inventory increases and rates rise. Overall, we are headed toward a more balanced market, which is a good thing.I hope that this information has been insightful to you.

Find out exactly what you can afford in the buying processâgetting pre-qualified with a lender is a great first step. You should also determine your homeâs value.

With this option, youâll know the equity you have for a new house and you wonât have to pay two mortgages at the same time. You may need interim housing for when youâre without a home. We can even negotiate a leaseback with the buyer of your current home.  Buying and selling simultaneously. This is doable, but it takes a good amount of planning and flexibility. For example, home inspections and appraisals must be done as soon as possible to get the ball rolling. Thankfully, If your buyer isnât pressured to move in right away, youâre less pressured to find a home immediately. Or, the buyer can close escrow and allow you to rent the home in the meantime.There are pros and cons to each, but we can help you find the best option for your situation. If youâd like some guidance, have questions, or need information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.",
