It is true, Maricopa and Pinal counties have officially dropped below 60% on the affordability scale, but what does that mean?

We like to see affordability at 60% or above for a healthy real estate market. **We are now at 56.4%,** which is nearly identical to the national average. This means the typical family making the median income can only afford 56% of the homes for sale right now. This is below where we want it, but it’s not too far below.

**Many of our zip codes and cities have trended down in terms of pricing and demand.** The sale prices haven’t come down, but we are starting to shift away from the nutty market we’ve been seeing. Last month, we saw as many as 25 offers on a home, but now we’re seeing maybe four or five.

The very first shift we should see is with the number of price reductions. **For the last 18 months, we have seen none at all, but now we are seeing some reductions.** It’s not like we’re falling off a cliff; 56% of home sales are above the listing price, so we’re trending towards a weaker seller’s market.

We do need to see more inventory, which has been creeping up in recent weeks. According to The Cromford Report, on the demand side, we have 110%, which is 10% over a balanced market, but **on the supply side, we are at 31%, which is 69% below normal.** We’re still very short on supply, and though we have had more recently, it’s still a big shortage.

We have seen over the last 18 months anywhere between 3% to 5% appreciation for property values. That is not normal, not sustainable. We’re expecting that to shift down to a more balanced point of about 0.5%.
