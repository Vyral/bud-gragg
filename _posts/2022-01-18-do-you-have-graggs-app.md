Do you have our app? We have a Keller Williams app specific to our team, and the best part about it is the geographical location of properties.

Whenever I'm driving around, I like to check our app and take a look at the properties around me out of curiosity. When you’re out and about **you’ll be able to check and see the information and photos of any available properties around you.** Additionally, if you want to see the property, our app will notify me, and I can meet you there. It’s a great app, and I highly recommend you download it from [graggsapp.com](http://graggsapp.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
