<center><em>Wire fraud can affect anyone, and here&rsquo;s how to avoid it.</em></center>

&nbsp;

Cybercrime is affecting real estate in a big way. Though none of our clients have been targeted, we want to make you aware of what’s going on—specifically, with wire fraud.

**Hackers have been getting into the emails of buyers and sellers in the middle of a transaction**. Then, they pose as a title company and give the victim new wiring instructions. The victim then sends the money to the hacker, and the money is lost.

To avoid this, make sure you’re working with true professionals who can align you with the right title company. They need a secure email setting and personal contact with the buyer and seller; **this way, wiring constructions can be communicated accurately with the actual title company**.

If you’d like a copy of our wire fraud advisory information, feel free to reach out to us. Otherwise, we’d be more than happy to answer any questions you may have. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
