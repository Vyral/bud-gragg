We hold many different titles and designations. Here&rsquo;s what they all mean.

Have you ever noticed all of the titles that Kristin and I have behind our names? Titles like ABR, CSA, CNE, RCSD, etc. Today I just wanted to give you a quick overview of all the designations that we hold and how earning them has allowed us to develop our wide breadth of real estate knowledge:


  Certified Residential Specialist (CRS) means that we’re specialists in the residential realm of real estate sales.
  Graduate, Realtor Institute (GRI) means that we know how to handle everything.
  E-PRO is a designation that means we are up to date on all the latest real estate technology and know-how to use it to help ourselves and our clients.
  ABR stands for Accredited Buyer’s Representative.


“All these titles show how much we care about helping our clients succeed.”


  CSA stands for Certified Staging Advocate. This is all about preparing your home like a product for sale. Little details matter, and we know which ones matter most.
  CNE stands for Certified Negotiation Expert and MCNE stands for Master Certified Negotiation Experts. These are two designations that we’ve earned in the art of the deal. Using tactics and leveraging market conditions to your benefit is what we do.
  Broker. This is one of our fundamental designations. Anybody can pass the real estate licensing exam, but a broker has taken it to the next level with an additional 90 hours of training and another state exam. I’ve been a broker for over 20 years.
  RCS-D is our newest designation. It stands for Real Estate Collaborative Specialist- Divorce. To put that simply, it means we have been trained to handle this specific type of real estate situation dealing with a divorcing or divorced couple. There are a lot of pitfalls to be wary of in a situation like this, but we know how to handle them.


All of these titles and designations are our way of showing you how much we care about representing you to the best of our abilities no matter your situation. If you or someone you know wants to buy, sell, or invest in real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you.

Today I&rsquo;m sharing the differences between the real estate market in 2005 and 2020.

Today I’m discussing 2005 versus 2020. Recently, we were asked by a buyer if she should wait until the market crash is over to buy a home. She believed wholeheartedly that we were headed for a market crash. About a year ago, I did a market update concerning the real estate market here in the Valley and we anticipated a bit of a slowdown in 2019. However, guess what? I was wrong. 2019 saw interest rates below 4%, which boosted the economy.

There’s a consensus out there that a recession is imminent and there will be another downturn in the market in 2020. Times have changed, and there are quite a few differences between the years 2005 and 2020. At the end of 2019, U.S. unemployment is at 3.5%, the lowest it’s been since June 1953. When adjusted for inflation, today’s home prices are lower than at the peak of 2006, which contributed to the crash.

Subprime and non-prime mortgage lending are at record lows—less than 5% in today’s market, as compared to 20% in 2005. That was the single biggest difference in the real estate market crash of 2006 to 2007. Today, there are stricter lending guidelines and standards, reducing the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on their mortgages. Today, homebuyers are more cautious, and they’re electing to retain equity in their homes instead of borrowing against them, as in the disaster of 2005.

“2019 saw interest rates below 4%, which boosted the economy.”

We are in a strong, steady, appreciating market, as opposed to a fast peak and a quick valley. Keep in mind that, nationwide, there are different markets and different stories. Here in Phoenix, 202 people a day are still moving to Maricopa County. Businesses are relocating here in droves.

If you have any real estate needs, even just a referral for a vendor, get in touch with us by phone or email. We would love to help you.

What can you gain by investing in real estate? Let me tell you a quick story to answer this question.

To illustrate the benefits of real estate investing, I want to tell you a quick story.

It all starts about 22 years ago when we were living in a subdivision in Mountain Park Ranch (my “office” was the front of my house). One day a neighbor visited us and said she’d been saving money for three or four years so she could buy a boat for her family. She had between $45,000 and $50,000 in the bank, and she was ready to pull the trigger.

That’s when she asked, “Should I pay cash for this boat?” We took a second to think about it and said no. Then we told her what we’d do instead—and what we recommended she should do.

We told her to take that $50,000 and use it to buy two rental properties (3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a 2-car garage, 1,600 square feet, etc.) worth roughly $200,000 at 10% down. Financing was about 6% to 7% at the time, which made the mortgage payments about $1,000 to $1,100 per month. If you were to rent these properties at $1,300 to $1,500, that would mean a cash flow of $300 per month for each.

Then, if she were to use financing to purchase the boat for, say, $40,000 at an amortization timeline of 80 months, that would cost $400 per month. With the $600 in cash flow, she’d be able to cover the boat payment with $200 to spare for gas, repairs, etc.

“Sure enough, the next day we watched as she came home and backed her new boat into her driveway.”

By doing this, her tenants would be paying for both of the mortgages on her properties and the boat. What’s more, those properties would each be worth about $400,000 today. That would give her $800,000 in real estate assets, and they would more or less be paid off at this time. Not to mention all the tax benefits she could take advantage of.

We spent about an hour laying out this scenario to her. Sure enough, the next day we watched as she came home and backed her new boat into her driveway. That’s right—she used the cash to buy the boat.

Granted, not everyone has the stomach to be a landlord, and we’re still dear friends with this neighbor. We’ve even been on her boat a few times. To her credit, she’s used it a lot over the years, which is what you should do with assets that depreciate over time.

If you’d like to talk more about investing in residential real estate and how it could benefit you, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to hear from you.

We wanted to quickly let you know the best way to refer us to your friends and family.

 

Thank you so much for your referrals over the years! We cannot tell you how grateful we are for you and all that you’ve done for us. This is an extension of the last blog post we did about referring us. Feel free to watch that video here!

Today’s message is about referring us the correct way. We just want to ask you a tiny favor about referring us. After you have recommended us, please don’t just give them our business card or tell them our information. What we would like you to say is: “Do you mind if I have Bud and Kristin call you?” Then send us their contact information.

This way, they’ll be expecting our phone call. That’s the way we can effectively communicate with them. There are countless times that we’ve heard from you, our past clients, that you told someone about us (which is great!), but we never hear from them.

“Please don’t just give someone our business card.”

We ask that you let us contact them so that we can take care of them the way we’ve taken care of you in the past. There’s no pressure. It doesn’t matter whether they’re buying or selling even two years from now—we’re never going to pressure anyone.

We greatly appreciate all of you for what you’ve done for us. Thank you! If you ever have any questions concerning real estate, please feel free to reach out to us by phone or email. We would love to help you!

Here&rsquo;s what we can do for anyone you know buying or selling a home.

 

I’ve been in the real estate business for over 25 years, and it never ceases to amaze me when people don’t realize that we’re their trusted source for referrals.

Are you or anyone you know moving from the Phoenix metropolitan area to anywhere else in the world? Call us. For outgoing referrals, we have a network of amazing agents all over the globe who we’ll contact on your behalf. We’ll vet them, interview them, and set you up with an experienced Realtor who will help you. During this process, we make it a point to keep in touch with you and share our insight. We also handle incoming referrals—meaning anyone moving to the Phoenix metropolitan area.

In addition to that, we handle referrals for buyers and sellers even if they aren’t moving to or from the Phoenix area. Just two months ago, I handled a referral for a beachfront property in Panama.

“No matter where they’re moving, we’ll take great care of your friends and family.”

No matter where they’re moving, we’ll take great care of your friends and family, so don’t hesitate to give us a call and let us be your referral source.

If you have any questions or have any real estate needs, call or email me anytime. I’d love to speak with you.

        <description>

Today I have a quick message about one of my favorite subjects: real estate investing.

 

Have you been thinking of investing in real estate to build your wealth? If so, I have good news: I have honestly never seen a better time to invest. It’s a perfect storm here in the Valley; interest rates have never been lower, and there are rumors that they’re going to edge down a little more. If they do, it’ll be a long-term record; they’ve never been that low.

Here’s a relevant story:

I own a rental property by Intel in Chandler, and it’s not a fancy, upscale home by any stretch. It’s a Shea Home with three bedrooms, two-and-a-half baths, 2,000 square feet, a loft pool, and a Jacuzzi in the backyard. I fixed it up to look nice and put it on the market about 10 days ago. In just two days, I had over 30 inquiries to rent the property and three applications—I hadn’t even shown the property yet!

“I have honestly never seen a better time to invest.”

This clearly indicates that demand is through the roof. As a landlord, this is very exciting to me because I get to cherry-pick the best tenants. I did a two-year lease and got $2,300 for the place, which is $150 more than the last tenant. The tenant is single and a surgeon, so I’m confident she can afford the place. At $2,300 a month, that comes out to $55,000 I made when I signed that lease. Sure, I’m paying the principal, interest, taxes, and insurance on the property, but I’ve got $700 to $800 cash flow that I can channel towards the principal to pay the property down over the course of 10 years.

So, if you’ve ever thought about investing in real estate here in the Valley, reach out to me. I would love to help you create wealth like I have done with so many others in real estate, including myself. There are all different types of properties to invest in for different reasons, and we can discuss which would be right for your goals. Hope to hear from you soon!

If you&rsquo;re about to move, follow this checklist to ensure a smooth transition.

 

Moving can be stressful, but remembering to follow a few important steps can make it much less so. There are several things people often forget when moving, and today we’ll be highlighting just a few. The next time you pack your bags to head to a new home, always make sure to complete these crucial tasks:

1. Determine if you’ll need to switch banks. Unless your old bank happens to have a branch near your new home, you may need to switch banks entirely. This may be tedious, but you’ll be glad you did it once you’re done.

2. Find a new healthcare provider and pharmacy. Calling your current doctor to have prescriptions transferred to a pharmacy near your new home will give you plenty of time to search for a new healthcare provider after you’ve moved in. Of course, you should still keep the contact information for your old doctor so that you can have paperwork and medical recorders forwarded once you’ve got a new provider.

3. Transfer your memberships to local clubs or gyms.

4. Request records from your children’s school(s). This way, you can take these records with you to their new school district.

5. Raid the kitchen. About a month before you move, start thawing out and using the food you’ve had sitting in your freezer and refrigerator so that they are clean and empty before moving day. 6. Get your car checked up. Your vehicle should be in good working order before you make the trip to your new home.

7. Transfer your utilities. Electricity, gas, trash collection, internet, and all other utilities will need to be canceled and/or transferred.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

How long does it actually take to sell a house? That&rsquo;s a complicated question.

 

“How long does it take to sell a house?”

Truth be told, that’s a loaded question.

According to Realtor.com, the average number of days on market across the country is about 65 days. However, there are some different factors that I like to bring up when answering this question for clients:

1. Location. How close are you to a main street or a transportation hub in your town? This can play a huge part in today’s buyer’s decision to purchase your home, and how quickly they do so.

2. Price. Obviously, you don’t want to overprice your home when you place it on the market. I discussed the dangers of pricing your home too high in a previous video, which you can watch here. If you do, you’ll shrink the pool of buyers looking at your home, and it could also cause issues with the appraisal if you actually did find a buyer who was willing to pay too much—that’s a topic for another time.

3. Inventory. How many homes in your neighborhood are currently up for sale? We’ve seen neighborhoods with no houses for sale, which is ideal because that means there’s no competition. However, we’ve also seen neighborhoods with so many houses for sale that it’s almost impossible to calculate how long it would take to sell your home.

“If a buyer is offering you a cash deal, then your house can in as few as seven days.”

4. School districts. This tends to be a huge factor for buyers, especially those with children. A lot of people visit school rating websites to see what schools are like in an area.

5. Walkability. Did you know that fewer and fewer people are driving these days? Walkability is an important criterion for today’s buyers. Is your house somewhere close to coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants, or nightlife attractions? Having a better walkability score makes your home more marketable.

6. Type of buyer. What kinds of buyers are looking to purchase your home? If they’re offering you a cash deal, then your house can close in as few as seven days. Financed buyers like those with FHA or VA loans will take a bit longer. The rule of thumb is to establish a 30-day close of escrow once you get a buyer with a loan.

If you have any questions about selling a home or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. We’re here to be your resource.

As a seller, overpricing your home is one of the worst things you can do&mdash;here&rsquo;s why.

 

What’s the single biggest reason overpricing your home is a mistake?

That’s easy—it won’t sell. Your home’s days on market is like acid to its sale price. The longer it sits on the market at the wrong price, the less you’ll get for it in the long run. Buyers don’t care about how much money you want to put in your pocket. All they care about is getting a fair market price.

When you overprice your home, what you’re actually doing is helping all the other comparable homes in the area sell. Your home might be gorgeous, but buyers make decisions based on value.

“Your home’s days on market is like acid to its sale price.”

The barometer of your home’s true value is how many interested buyers walk through its front door. How do we know? Whenever our team lists a property for one of our clients, we know that it’s overpriced if we only get one or two showings in the first week. After we adjust the price and start attracting five to 10 showings per week, we know we’re close to getting an offer. If we still don’t get an offer after this period, however, we’ll make another small adjustment.

This is why it’s important to price your home correctly from the get-go when you list it.

If you have any other real estate questions for me or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

Wire fraud can affect anyone, and here&rsquo;s how to avoid it.

 

Cybercrime is affecting real estate in a big way. Though none of our clients have been targeted, we want to make you aware of what’s going on—specifically with wire fraud.

Hackers have been getting into the emails of buyers and sellers in the middle of a transaction. Then, they pose as a title company and give the victim new wiring instructions. The victim then sends the money to the hacker, and the money is lost.

“Make sure you’re working with true professionals.”

To avoid this, make sure you’re working with true professionals who can align you with the right title company. They need a secure email setting and personal contact with the buyer and seller; this way, wiring constructions can be communicated accurately with the actual title company.

If you’d like a copy of our wire fraud advisory information, feel free to reach out to us. Otherwise, we’d be more than happy to answer any questions you may have. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

The market has changed a bit, but can sellers still get a great price for their home? Let&rsquo;s find out.

 

Today we’ll be taking a quick look at how our current market affects sellers in particular.

The Phoenix market is still favoring sellers over buyers, but not as much as it was at the beginning of 2018. This year’s supply is 34% below normal—only slightly better than last year’s supply, which was 36% below the mark. As buyers face affordability issues and concerns about an overvalued market, demand continues to shift.

At this time last year, demand was 1% above normal. Now, it’s 13% below normal. Though it may feel like a buyer’s market when compared to the last few years, Phoenix is still very much a seller’s market—it’s just a little weaker than last year.

“Phoenix is still very much a seller’s market—it’s just a little weaker than last year.”

There’s still more demand than there is supply, but multiple-offer situations will no longer be the norm, and there will likely be fewer sales overall. Depending on interest rates, demand could change in either direction. As of now, though, buyers and sellers still have some good opportunities in the market. 

If you have any questions or would like further information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

I&rsquo;ve got great news for homebuyers in the Phoenix area. There&rsquo;s a great opportunity for you in our market right now.

 

Today we’ve got a quick update for buyers in the real estate market. The January numbers are in and I’m excited to share them with you.

The average interest rate rose to 4.64% at the end of 2018, which is up 0.69% from a year ago. For buyers that purchase a home at the median sale price of $260,000, that’s about $100 more on your monthly mortgage payment from last year.

Buyers averaged 1,845 sq ft. at this price, which is nearly 100 square feet smaller than the average from a year ago.

“Home prices will continue to rise, but at a slower pace than in the past.”

Renting may not be a suitable alternative anymore. Single-family homes appreciated by an average of 8.1% and single-family lease payments increased by about 8.6%, as well. Buying is still a better option over renting, even if it’s just to stabilize your monthly housing expenses.

Home prices will continue to rise in the first half of 2019, but at a slower rate than in years past. You might see a little more negotiation on the seller’s behalf for closing costs, concessions, etc. This is good news for buyers overall.

If you’re looking to buy a home here in the Phoenix area, we are the only call you’ll ever need to make. If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Whether you&rsquo;re buying or selling a home, the safest way to get started is by calling a Realtor such as myself.

 

What is the safest way to buy and/or sell a home? There are a couple points to be made regarding this question.

First of all, I consider buying a home the safest investment you can make. It’s an appreciating asset that allows you to build equity. You can pay down your principal and interest over time and enjoy certain tax benefits.

“The safest way to actually buy or sell a home is by calling an agent such as myself.”

Secondly, the safest way to actually buy or sell a home is by calling an agent such as myself. Whether you’re finding a property that suits your needs as a buyer or trying to market your home and get the best deal possible as a seller, you need the expertise of a Realtor. I’d love to help you in either case.

Remember, if you’re thinking of buying or selling a home or you have any questions about our real estate market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you.

        <description>

Here are the stats from the fourth quarter of the 2018 real estate market year for the entire Phoenix area.

 

Like the stock market, in real estate, there’s good and bad news to be found on any given day.

Here is some news that isn’t necessarily bad, though it might seem that way for the uncertain: Every single mortgage broker, banker, and financial planner that I know is advising that mortgage interest rates are going to hit 6%, or possibly even higher. This is a no-brainer because there’s really only one way for rates to go (which is up). We’ve been very, very spoiled with interest rates for about the last eight years now, as they’ve been ridiculously low.

Buyers who are looking to make a home purchase but are currently on the fence should get in touch with me as soon as possible—higher interest rates mean more interest costs on your mortgage loan. Generally, higher rates mean less buying power, so the higher the rate, the less home you’ll be able to afford. By waiting, homes that are available right now might not be within your reach if rates go up higher.

Higher interest rates also mean that sellers might not be that apt to put their home on the market, meaning that there will be less inventory. If they’ve got a locked-in 4% rate, they’re not going to jump at a 6% or 6.5%.

“Four of the top five cities for job growth in the country are located right here in Maricopa County.”

The good news is that tech companies are blowing up the Valley of Sun. Companies like Intel, American Express, eBay, Uber, Shutterfly, and Infusionsoft all have something in common: They’re either expanding or relocating their entire company here to the Valley. Every day, at least 202 are moving to Maricopa County.

An analysis that was conducted by ranking the future job-growth projections of 182 cities in the United States came up with this top five list:


  Chandler, Arizona
  Scottsdale, Arizona
  San Francisco, California
  Peoria, Arizona
  Gilbert, Arizona


That’s right! Four of the top five cities for growth are located right here in Maricopa County. And, according to research done by Zillow, Phoenix, Denver, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Las Vegas, and San Jose will outperform the rest of the United States in 2019.

The bottom line is that we are currently living in the strongest economy in the U.S., and we don’t expect that to change for a while. We have seen steep appreciation over the past eight years, so I understand people’s reluctance to act in the market. However, we believe that appreciation will slow down as inventory increases and rates rise. Overall, we are headed toward a more balanced market, which is a good thing.

I hope that this information has been insightful to you. If you’re thinking of buying, selling, or investing in real estate, you only need to reach out to us. Either myself or Kristin would be happy to help.

        <description>

Today I&rsquo;m answering some of the most common questions that I hear from prospective homebuyers. They offer a unique insight into the mind of today&rsquo;s buyer.

 

We recently had our pie giveaway and it’s always one of our favorite events of the year. We give away free Thanksgiving pies, have some snacks and libations, and get to talk to a lot of our “VICs” (Very Important Clients). After getting to talk to so many of you about your lives and about real estate, we wanted to answer a few of the most common questions that we heard from you today.

“Having rented for decades, what are the benefits of homeownership other than building equity? If the current market is a seller’s market, is it a good time to buy or should I wait?”

First and foremost, you’re building equity for yourself as well as getting tax benefits from mortgage interest and property taxes. If you’re renting, you’re giving those benefits to your landlord and not reaping any of them yourself. Stop making your landlord rich and get into a property that you’ll live in and build wealth from through the years.

“Our market is currently leveling out.”

As for the second part of the question, our market is currently leveling out right now. This is good news for buyers because there is more to choose from. However, mortgage rates are on the rise, so the window of opportunity is closing for buyers to jump off the fence.

If you have any other questions about real estate or if you’re interested in buying or selling a home in the near future, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

Buying and selling homes simultaneously is entirely possible; you just need some preparation.

 

There are a few ways you can go about buying and selling homes at the same time. You can buy first and then sell, sell first and then buy, or you can conduct a concurrent/simultaneous close of escrow.

Before you try any of these options, there are some things you need to know. Find out exactly what you can afford in the buying process—getting pre-qualified with a lender is a great first step. You should also determine your home’s value. By doing this, you’ll know how much equity you have and can figure out what you can afford as a down payment.

“There are pros and cons to each, but we can help you find the best option for your situation.”

Here’s how the three strategies we listed earlier work:


  Buying first. By doing this, you can enjoy a pressure-free search without having to worry about selling your current home. You also won’t need interim housing and can move without any rush. However, you may be having to pay two mortgages temporarily and you won’t know how much equity you have for the down payment on your new home. We’re good at getting a close estimate, but the exact amount is unknown.
  Selling first. With this option, you’ll know the equity you have for a new house and you won’t have to pay two mortgages at the same time. You may need interim housing for when you’re without a home. We can even negotiate a leaseback with the buyer of your current home.
  Buying and selling simultaneously. This is doable, but it takes a good amount of planning and flexibility. For example, home inspections and appraisals must be done as soon as possible to get the ball rolling. Thankfully, If your buyer isn’t pressured to move in right away, you’re less pressured to find a home immediately. Or, the buyer can close escrow and allow you to rent the home in the meantime.


There are pros and cons to each, but we can help you find the best option for your situation. If you’d like some guidance, have questions, or need information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.
