I’m so excited to announce that we are now serving the White Mountains area. That’s right\! Our real estate team is expanding\! Our range of service now includes Payson, Pine Strawberry, Pinetop, Show Low, Heber-Overgaard, Lakeside, Winslow, and all the surrounding communities.

If you or someone you know is looking to buy a second home or a winter/summer cabin as a vacation or investment property, **now is a great time to do so**. Don’t hesitate to reach out to us for more information, and if you have any questions about real estate in general, we’re your go-to team. Hope to hear from you soon\!
