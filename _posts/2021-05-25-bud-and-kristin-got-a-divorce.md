Professor Kelly Murray has law degrees both from Harvard and Stanford, and she is currently on staff at Vanderbilt teaching family law to judges and attorneys across the nation. We’ve trained extensively under her, and I want to share some things we've learned under her divorce designation curriculum.

Your family home is usually the most significant asset in divorce mediation, often coming with significant debt. However, **appraisal minus mortgage balance does not equal equity.** This incomplete equation leaves your house overvalued, and that works against you in family mediation for divorce. Don't settle for a bad property settlement statement in addition to the inaccurate and unfair division of the property. You risk damaging your credit, default, foreclosure, and maybe even bankruptcy.

We will help you retain the wherewithal to be able to refinance and stay in your home if it's applicable or purchase a home after the divorce is final. We can't guarantee anything, but you or whoever you know that is going through divorce needs to get in touch with us as soon as possible before mediation or even before contacting your attorney.

Remember all those documents that you signed when you bought your house? Most of those documents are not anywhere to be found. **We provide free help to gather the house documents that you need** to make an informed, accurate decision to move forward with the divorce proceedings. The more accurate information they have, the better they can represent you in the mediation, proceedings, and divorce trial.

We've partnered with leading professionals including a mortgage lender who has studied under the same curriculum as us. She has the RCSD designation as well, and she's very familiar with divorce home inspectors, termite inspections, inspectors, title companies, and appraisers. **We have the whole team ready to help you.**

If you or anyone you know has decided to get divorced, please contact us right away. We will take really good care of them and help them keep their financial eye on the ball while they're going through this stressful process. Have a great day.
