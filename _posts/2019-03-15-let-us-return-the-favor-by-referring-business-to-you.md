<center><em>Nothing makes us happier than receiving a phone call from you referring a new seller, buyer, or investor to us. But today&rsquo;s video is about us referring business to you.</em></center>

&nbsp;

We love getting your referrals—we really do. Our business thrives on referrals, so we appreciate every phone call in which we’re referred to a new seller, buyer, or investor.

But today’s message is about *you*.

**If you’re the owner of a business that we could refer any business to, let us know**. It could be anything—if you’re an attorney or a CPA, or if you have a pool service company, we want to help you spread the word and grow your business, as well.

We have some ideas on how we can do that for you, as well as some ideas for opportunities you can get involved with.

If you’re a business owner who could benefit from our referrals, we definitely want to hear from you. **Let us know what you’ve got so we can promote it and help you have an amazing business year**. Feel free to reach out to us! We hope to hear from you soon.
